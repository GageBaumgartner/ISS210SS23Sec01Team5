                <div class="container"><p><center>The differences in education in first versus third world countries allows for unequal and unfair education opportunities for children across the world. This is important to us, as we are students at Michigan State University; we do not know about the full stories of those struggling to obtain a basic education in developing nations, but we can use our voices to call for change.  <br><br>So, why does providing fair educational opportunities matter? Well, we know that educational disparities are correlated with skin color, ethnicity, linguistic and social class status. And over time, inequality of denial of equivalent access and opportunities have been compounding, having adverse effects on lower status groups. Without intervention, the gap in the quality of schooling will increase as it has been, making it more difficult for groups of people (and their countries as a whole) to be successful in their educational achievement.  <br><br>Luckily, there are always ways to help out; some things that can help lead to fair schooling opportunities are increasing equal educational material access among first and third world countries, participation, social networks, access to credit to overcome cost barriers, and increasing the motivation/drive for success from teachers and students alike.  <br><br>Education must be more regulated everywhere so that children–regardless of their class or status–have identical abilities/chances to learn, grow, and improve their ways of life.</center></p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The excerpts show that rich people in more developed countries have more opportunities for a great education compared to those who are not as wealthy and in 3rd world countries. This creates an unfair situation where talented children from poor backgrounds and countries are unable to reach their full potential and contribute to society. Meanwhile, those with money can access better education and have greater chances of success.This creates a system where brilliant individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are unable to fulfill their potential and contribute fully to society, while those with financial resources are better positioned to access quality education and succeed.The excerpts highlight that in the poorest countries, many children don't have the chance to receive a basic education. This lack of access to education keeps them trapped in poverty and makes it difficult for them to improve their lives. To address this, it is important to offer education that is available to everyone, free of charge, and provided by the government. This can help break the cycle of poverty and give all children, regardless of their family's wealth, the opportunity to learn and succeed.</p>

The government has launched various initiatives such as the School Performance Management System, which tracks the performance of schools and teachers, and the Punjab Education Foundation, which provides funding and resources to low-cost private schools. The government has also increased funding for education and introduced reforms to improve teacher training and curriculum development.  <br><br>These efforts have resulted in improvements in student enrollment, attendance, and learning outcomes. One teacher’s words about the schooling techniques particularly stands out–she says, “We were taught about activity-based learning, and how to teach so that children learn properly while enjoying. It is a big difference.” These types of efforts are vital to making education an equal experience around the world, as it is a common occurrence that once schooling is brought to developing regions, its quality still remains poor and therefore children do not receive the education they need and deserve.</p>

On international tests for high-income countires the mean score in 2015 was 497 while in low-income countries the mean score was 411. So on average students will do better on international tests if they are from high-income countires. <br><br>In high-income countries the mean teacher student ratio is 9 teachers to 100 students. And for low-income countries it is 6 teachers to 100 students. Countires that have higher incomes are able to provide more teachers per student. This allows for more personal attention to students, which often cause the students to perform better if they can seek help compared to low-income countires. <br><br>While in high income countries the mean public expenditure per secondary student in % GDP per capita is 23.38, as for low income countries the mean is 17.95. Higher income countries are able to fund public education with more money than those countries that are lower income. This could cause the education system in low income countries to not be able to provide the necessary treatment to the students.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Online schooling can be a promising solution for bringing education to 3rd world countries. With internet access, students in remote areas can receive quality education from anywhere in the world. Online learning platforms can provide access to a wide range of educational resources, including interactive content, video lectures, and digital textbooks. Moreover, online schooling can help overcome challenges such as lack of infrastructure, funding, and teacher shortages. Overall, online schooling has the potential to provide equal educational opportunities to students in 3rd world countries.

The disparities between the richest and poorest people, as well as those living in rural and urban regions, have not diminished.  17% of the world's children, adolescents, and youth, are not in school. The proportion is substantially higher in developing countries: 31% in Sub-Saharan Africa and 21% in Central Asia, compared to 3% in Europe and North America. Because education has been shown to impact general well-being, productivity, social capital, responsible citizenship, and sustainable behavior, the severity of the situation in third-world nations can be substantial. Its equal distribution enables the development of permeable societies and equity.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">This book goes into detail about the critical importance of education for children's future success in the impoverished regions of Indonesia. In Chapters 1/2, the authors highlight that the critical stages of development that occur in the early years of childhood is when early education is necessary; they explain that from the prenatal period to six years of age is when the central nervous system, brain cells, and neural pathways are thriving, which would in turn mean that this time frame is crucial for “laying the foundations for a child’s future trajectory or pathway through life.” And while the experiences they may have later on have the capability to shape their future as well, those initial stages of development greatly impact lifelong behaviors and learning efficiencies. <br><br>Furthermore, an analysis of a study conducted on these children showed a direct correlation between receiving high-quality early education services and employment rates/outcomes as they moved from adolescence into adulthood (which would therefore also provide economic benefits to society as a whole). In fact, children who did not receive as excellent of early schooling were sadly “25 percent more likely to drop out of school, 40 percent more likely to become a teen parent, 50 percent more likely to be placed in special education, 60 percent more likely to never attend college, and 70 percent more likely to be arrested for a violent crime,” which is truly heart-wrenching, as they are only children and cannot alter the socioeconomic position they were placed in. These statistics reveal just how essential the proper education of children in developing countries is to their wellbeing in the years to come.</p>
